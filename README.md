# APCS - Stuyrim

## Features

Make a clear list of features that work/dont work

:white_check_mark: This feature works.

:question: This feature works partially.

:ballot_box_with_check: This extra (beyond the things that the lab was supposed to do) feature works.

:x: This required feature does not work.

:beetle: This is a bug that affects the game.


## Character.Adventurer Subclasses

replace this with your documentation for your two Character.Adventurer subclasses. If you modify or replace the provided Character.CodeWarrior class, please provide documentation for that as well.

### ok so the way we will do this is we implement one from every table and then if we still have time left after we will add the others. spending 50 hours on making a bijillion classes before we have anything else is a bad idea. do not spend 50 hours making a bijillion classes unless we have nothing else to do.

# Status system

The only status (SO FAR) is prepardness, there is 3 possible states of it:

- Prepared

- Unprepared

- No status (will be referred to as "not prepared")
